# From Complexity to Clarity in Supply Chain Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing supply chain data to identify inefficiencies in inventory, shipments, and order fulfillment. Using Python for analysis and Tableau for visualization, the goal was to convert raw operational data into clear insights that can support better business decisions.

## Project Overview

The dataset represents a real-world supply chain scenario involving orders, inventory, shipments, and fulfillment. In this project, I explored key operational challenges such as shipment delays, inventory imbalance, and fulfillment performance, and summarized the findings using interactive dashboards.

The analysis is structured to help business stakeholders:

* Understand current supply chain performance
* Identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks
* Explore data-driven improvement opportunities

---

## Objectives

* Analyze shipment and inventory-related issues
* Identify patterns in supply, demand, and fulfillment
* Evaluate business performance using key metrics
* Build interactive dashboards for decision support

---

## Methodology

**Analysis Type**

* Descriptive Analysis
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Tools Used**

* **Python**: Data preprocessing, cleaning, EDA, inventory segmentation
* **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards and storytelling

---

## Dashboard Coverage

### Business Performance

* Product-wise profit and cost analysis
* Total profit and top-performing products
* High-cost inventory identification

### Inventory Management

* Supply vs demand analysis
* Overstocked and understocked products
* Inventory storage costs by warehouse

### Shipment Analysis

* Percentage of delayed shipments
* Delay trends over time
* Shipment delays by location and product

### Order Fulfillment

* Average fulfillment time by product category
* Warehouse-level fulfillment performance

---

## Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

All preprocessing and data cleaning were performed using Python. This included handling missing values, formatting date fields, and preparing structured datasets suitable for analysis and visualization.

---

## Dataset Overview

The project uses three primary datasets:

* **Orders & Shipments**
* **Inventory**
* **Fulfillment**

### Key Data Dimensions

* **Customer**: Customer identifiers and location details
* **Orders**: Order date, product, quantity, and order value
* **Shipments**: Shipping date, shipping mode, and delays
* **Products**: Product name, category, and department
* **Warehouse Inventory**: Inventory levels, storage costs, warehouse location, and fulfillment data

---

## Key Insights

### Profit & Cost Analysis

* Identification of the most profitable departments and products
* Products with the highest profit margins
* Inventory items with the highest storage costs

### Inventory Analysis

* Supply vs demand imbalance across product categories
* Overstocked and understocked product groups

### Shipment Delays

* Products and locations with frequent delays
* Trends in delayed shipments

---

## Recommendations

### Optimize Inventory Levels

Adjust inventory planning for high-demand and high-profit products to reduce excess storage costs and prevent stockouts during peak demand periods.

### Improve Inventory Distribution

Rebalance inventory across warehouses, especially for departments with high demand but low stock, to minimize shipment delays and lost sales opportunities.

### Strengthen Marketing Focus

Promote products with higher profit margins and consider targeted campaigns during peak seasons to increase overall revenue.

### Reduce Shipment Delays

Further investigation into shipment bottlenecks is recommended to improve delivery timelines and enhance customer satisfaction.
